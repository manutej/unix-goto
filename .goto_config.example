# unix-goto Configuration
# Copy this file to ~/.goto_config and customize for your environment
#
# This file defines your core workspace directories.
# The 'bookmark sync' command will automatically create bookmarks
# for all subdirectories under these paths.

# HOW IT WORKS:
# 1. Add your main workspace paths below (one per line)
# 2. Run: bookmark sync
# 3. Automatic bookmarks created for all subdirectories
# 4. All bookmark names are lowercase for consistency
# 5. Changes sync automatically when you run 'bookmark sync' again

# EXAMPLE WORKFLOW:
# If you add: ~/work/projects
# And it contains: client-a, client-b, internal-tool
# You get bookmarks: @projects, @client-a, @client-b, @internal-tool
# Then use: goto @client-a

# Core workspace directories (one per line)
# Format: /absolute/path/to/workspace
# Lines starting with # are comments
# Tilde (~) and environment variables are supported

# Example configurations (uncomment and customize):
# ~/work/projects
# ~/code/personal
# ~/Development
# ~/workspace/active
# $HOME/code

# Your workspace directories:
# Add your paths below
