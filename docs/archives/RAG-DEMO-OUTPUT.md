## Example 6: Help and Discovery

### RAG Help Menu

```bash
$ goto --help-rag
goto RAG Extensions
===================

Enhanced navigation with notes and semantic search:

Commands:
  goto --note <text>              Add note for current directory
  goto --note --path <dir> <text> Add note for specific directory
  goto --recall <query>           Search notes semantically
  goto --what [path]              Show notes for directory (default: current)
  goto --summary [path]           Show folder summary with visit stats
  
Standalone Commands:
  goto-note <text>                Add note to current directory
  goto-note --path <dir> <text>   Add note to specific directory
  goto-note --tags tag1 tag2 <text> Add note with tags
  goto-recall <query>             Search all notes
  goto-what [path]                Show notes for directory
  goto-summary [path]             Show folder summary

Examples:
  # Add notes
  cd ~/project && goto-note "Fixed authentication bug in login API"
  goto-note --path ~/Documents/LUXOR --tags work project "Q1 planning docs"
  
  # Search notes
  goto-recall "authentication"
  goto-recall "where did I fix the cache issue"
  
  # View notes

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before RAG

```bash
$ cd ~/Documents/LUXOR/PROJECTS/HALCON
# Work on authentication...

# Week later: "Where did I implement OAuth?"
$ find ~ -name "*.py" -exec grep -l "oauth" {} \; 2>/dev/null
# ... hundreds of results ...

$ history | grep auth
# ... may or may not find it ...
```

### After RAG

```bash
$ cd ~/Documents/LUXOR/PROJECTS/HALCON
$ goto-note "Implemented OAuth2 authentication flow"
‚úì Note added

# Week later: "Where did I implement OAuth?"
$ goto-recall "OAuth"
üîç Found 1 results:

1. /Users/manu/Documents/LUXOR/PROJECTS/HALCON (score: 0.95)
   Implemented OAuth2 authentication flow
