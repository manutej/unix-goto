   2025-10-08 07:15:30
```

### Example 2: Cross-Project Search

```bash
# In project A
$ goto-note "Used Redis for caching"

# In project B  
$ goto-note "Need to implement caching like project A"

# Later, anywhere
$ goto-recall "Redis caching"
🔍 Found 2 results:

1. /path/to/project-A (score: 0.94)
   Used Redis for caching
   
2. /path/to/project-B (score: 0.88)
   Need to implement caching like project A
```

### Example 3: Folder Summary

```bash
$ goto-summary ~/Documents/LUXOR/PROJECTS/HALCON
📊 Summary for /Users/manu/Documents/LUXOR/PROJECTS/HALCON:

## 💡 Innovation Highlights

### Before goto RAG
```bash
# "Where did I work on OAuth?"
$ grep -r "OAuth" ~/Documents  # Noisy, slow
$ history | grep auth           # Limited, may miss it
$ git log --all --grep="OAuth"  # Per-repo only
```

### After goto RAG
```bash
# "Where did I work on OAuth?"
$ goto-recall "OAuth"
🔍 Found 1 results:
1. ~/Documents/LUXOR/PROJECTS/HALCON
   Implemented OAuth2 authentication flow
   
$ goto halcon  # Navigate there instantly
```

**Result: 2 seconds vs 5 minutes!** 🚀
