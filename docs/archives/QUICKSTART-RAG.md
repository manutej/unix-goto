## Advanced Features

### Tags for Organization

```bash
goto-note --tags backend python api "Refactored user service to use async/await"
goto-note --tags frontend react ui "Updated dashboard with new metrics"
goto-note --tags devops docker k8s "Configured Kubernetes deployment"
```

Search by tag concept:
```bash
goto-recall "kubernetes"  # Finds the devops note
```

### Notes for Specific Paths

```bash
# Add note without being in the directory
goto-note --path ~/Documents/LUXOR/PROJECTS/HALCON "Production deployment scheduled for Friday"

# Check notes
goto-what ~/Documents/LUXOR/PROJECTS/HALCON
```

## Integration with goto

All RAG features work seamlessly with your existing goto commands:

```bash
# Navigate as usual
goto luxor
goto halcon
goto GAI-3101

# Add notes along the way
goto-note "Working on feature X"

# Navigate somewhere else
goto infra

# Later, find where you worked on feature X
goto-recall "feature X"
```
