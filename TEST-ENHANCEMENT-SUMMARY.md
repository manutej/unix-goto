**Date**: 2025-10-17
**Linear Issues Addressed**: CET-87, CET-89, CET-90, CET-93

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive test suite enhancements for the unix-goto project, addressing quality assurance requirements and establishing production-ready testing infrastructure.

## Deliverables Summary

### 1. Edge Case Test Suite (CET-89) ✓

**File**: `/tests/unit/test-edge-cases.sh`

**Coverage**: 28 test cases covering:
- Invalid input handling (empty names, special characters, long names)
- Permission and filesystem issues (read/execute permissions, symlinks)
- Boundary conditions (path limits, overflow handling, corrupted files)
- Concurrent operations (race conditions, simultaneous writes)
- Cache system edge cases (missing dirs, stale entries, invalid permissions)
- Security testing (injection prevention, special character handling)

**Key Test Cases**:
- Empty bookmark names and null path inputs
- Directories without proper permissions
- Broken and circular symlinks
- Unicode and special characters in paths
- Extremely long paths (filesystem limits)
- Corrupted bookmark and history files
- Simultaneous write operations
- Path injection attempts (dollar signs, backticks, quotes)
